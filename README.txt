Weather Station 
Natural disasters that are related to weather causes loss in both lives and properties, but it can be detected and reported to avoid loss so design a weather station that measures temperature, humidity, pressure, and amplitude and record these readings for studying and send alert if any of the readings is abnormal. 
1. Measure temperature and humidity 
2. Measure pressure and amplitude
3. Record all readings in a document 
4. Send alert ( email ) if any reading exceeds a certain threshold 
5. Create a web application to review/control all above steps 

1. Hardware Components:
•ESP32 Development Board: To serve as the main controller.
•Temperature and Humidity Sensor (e.g., DHT22): To measure temperature and humidity.
•Bmp280: For measuring pressure and amplitude
•SD Card Module: For recording readings.
